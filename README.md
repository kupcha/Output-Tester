# Output-Tester
This file is used to check output of my programs against the output of given reference programs for school assignments. It will iterate through both files byte by byte to ensure they are equal. Specifically I wrote this program for encryption/decryption programs where it is not as obvious whether two files have the same contents.

Call make to compile, and simply pass two files when running the program to see if their contents are equal.
